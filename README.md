### About math-interpreter.

math_interpreter was written in way too many hours by Dustin Mundy, a not-yet graduate of the Codefellows 401 course in Seattle Washington specializing in ASP.NET.

Mind that at the time of writing, this application is not actually functional, and defies all logic as it appears to run several methods at once, prompting for several items at once and responding with a failure text only after two values have been entered. The content of these values do not appear to matter.

While Dustin learned quite a lot in developing this console application, C# is crazy and will require much more time to master.

This mastery had better come quick, as at the time of writing, even googling code snippits to assist in building this application has produced results that are "way over (the author's) head."
